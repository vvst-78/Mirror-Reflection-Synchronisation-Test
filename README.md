# Mirror-Reflection-Synchronisation-Test
AI video experiment exploring real-time mirror physics and gesture synchronisation in generative models.
## 🧠 Research goal

Test whether AI video models can maintain:

- temporal synchronisation  
- mirrored motion consistency  
- causal reflection behaviour  
- single-gesture continuity  

during close-up mirror interaction.

## ⚙️ Method

Single-shot generation.  
No cuts.  
Direct mirror interaction.  

Prompt emphasis:

- real-time mirror reflection  
- synchronous movement  
- no delay  
- no independent motion

## 🔍 Observations

- Models often desynchronise reflection  
- Micro-delay frequently appears  
- Gesture drift occurs over time  
- Reflection may act independently

## ✅ Successful cases

Two generations achieved near-perfect synchronisation:

- reflection timing matched gesture  
- minimal drift  
- coherent mirror physics

## 📌 Insight

AI video models tend to treat mirror imagery as a secondary scene rather than a physically bound reflection.

Prompting explicit synchronisation constraints significantly improves coherence.
